Want to see something exciting? Here’s a sneak peek of a custom item I was able to source for a sweet client:  You see they didn’t want the usual preprinted album that I sell….the dad’s childhood memory was of an oversized Jon Hart album that his parents had when he was growing up.  He had looked for the exact one but Jon Hart had stopped making it some time ago.  But it needed to be giant (to hold lots and lots of photos) and be something that the family could add to over time.  So I sourced a monster 14”x14” leather album with 100 pages- this thing is massive, and once the 600 photos are housed in it, I am fairly certain it might kill a small animal if you dropped it on them!  I can’t wait to see it once it is all stuffed with their family memories!! Do you have a special request?  Not a problem- I can do that!!⁣
