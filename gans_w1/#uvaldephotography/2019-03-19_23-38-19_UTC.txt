What will you be drinking this spring?  Finally the weather has begun to warm a bit, which means my summertime staple is making its comeback- Topo Chico with Ruby Red Vodka and a slice of lime. But to every drink there is a season (that’s what they say, right?) so I’m happily swapping out my hot chocolate and Peppermint Schnapps for this refreshing mixed drink.  Do you have a favorite adult beverage meant for poolside lounging?⁣
