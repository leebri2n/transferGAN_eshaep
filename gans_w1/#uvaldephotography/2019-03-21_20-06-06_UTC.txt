Wedding planning can be so stressful.  My job is to help alleviate some of that pressure.  I can walk you through the choices of what you want to accomplish with your wedding photos, ideas about how to make your engagement photos shine, and make suggestions on some lasting things to best remember the big day.  My biggest contribution will be to your day's timeline so that you can relax, enjoy the day and not feel hurried and stressed.⁣
