On the day of your wedding, I will be with you as much as your closest confidants, so its important that you feel comfortable with me and can trust that I will handle any unplanned circumstances that pop up.  As a mom myself, I have been known to keep that safety pin, extra thread and needle handy to take care of the unexpected things that always happen!  My job is to make you look and feel as beautiful as can be on one of the most important, memorable days of your life.⁣
