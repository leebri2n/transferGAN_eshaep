I was always a Daddy’s little girl….it really is a wonder I ever figured out how to cook, because growing up I was always outside following my dad around, watching him do whatever he needed to around our house.  Today is National Joe Day, so here is to you, Dad!! I knew you needed your own name day!  Love you the Most- and You’re it!!!⁣
