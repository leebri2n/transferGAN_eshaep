- 3.2:
  - Subsections: State what the experiment types:
    - Problem w control:
      - Did a run to find hyperparameters

    - Experiment 1:
      - Starting network correlated w pretraining dataset
      - ?: Architecture vs. weights - careful wording

    - Experiment 2:
      - NOt well defined?
      - Round -> experiment
      - Inspiration and hypothesis vs. actual results
        - Good and bad examples
      - Highlight how target and source dataset are similar
      - Group types of targets in figures

    - Augmentation: touch on which augmentations
      - DOn't talk ab what it is, but which ones it is
      - Understanding if augmentations cause a match in number of examples

    - Sizes
      - Experiment 2: talk about sizes of target datasets
      - Possibly table : sizes of datasets

    - Conclusions
      - Cite: EL papers: shown that combination matters
      - "initial work done by papers x, y z"
      - Other work in this area concerned abou this problem quanitfying differences between datasets and demonstrated impacts is ----, not done not gans, but proven to be important for computer vision. Future work questions if it's useufl to GANs.
